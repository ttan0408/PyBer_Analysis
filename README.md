# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Omar and our team have given a project to analyze the ride-sharing data for Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas. Our task to find out what is the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. After that we need to present the results for V. Isualize so that they can plan for their future development at PyBer.

## Analyze the data
Data provided to us into 2 different categories : citi and ride spreadsheet which combine total of 2800 data. We merged these two spreadsheet into 1 single dataset. 

## Results 

Rural area has the highest average fare per driver $55.49 and average fare per ride $ 34.62. This is because in the rural area there are less drivers (78 total drivers)

Urban area has the lowest average fare per driver  $16.57 and average fare per ride $ 24.53. This result makes sense because there are high supply ( 2405 total drivers) in urban area

The table summary of this can be see below :





V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
