# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Omar and our team have given a project to analyze the ride-sharing data for Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas. Our task to find out what is the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. After that we need to present the results for V. Isualize so that they can plan for their future development at PyBer.

# Analyze the data



V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
